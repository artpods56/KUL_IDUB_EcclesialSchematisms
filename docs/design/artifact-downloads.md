# Artifact downloads: format-aware export

- **Status:** Proposal (open for review)
- **Date:** 2026-08-13
- **Audience:** Engineers changing artifact persistence, the `/v1` artifacts API,
  or the workbench artifact viewer
- **Related:** [backend architecture](backend-architecture.md),
  [workbench interaction plan](../workbench-interaction-plan.md), and
  [product vocabulary](../../CONTEXT.md)

## Summary

Today artifacts can be *previewed* in the browser (table pages, geo tiles,
inline JSON) but there is no first-class, format-aware **download** path. The
only existing affordance is the raw `/content` endpoint, which streams whatever
bytes the artifact stores and sets `Content-Disposition` only when
`metadata["download_name"]` happens to be present.

This design introduces a small, explicit **download contract**: every artifact
declares the *export formats* it can be rendered into, a single endpoint turns
an artifact into a chosen format, and the frontend offers a **Download** action
on the **Artifact Viewer node** (under its "..." menu) with a format picker. It
does **not** change how artifacts are stored, resolved, or previewed.

### What this proposal does and does not change

**Does:**
- Add an `ArtifactExportFormat` / per-type format table to the artifact-type
  declaration layer.
- Add one new endpoint `GET /workspaces/{workspace_id}/artifacts/{artifact_id}/download?format=...`
  that renders the artifact into the requested format and returns it as a
  proper attachment.
- Add a **Download** item + format picker to the Artifact Viewer node's
  "..." overflow menu (replacing the table-only "Download JSON" link).
- Keep the existing `/content` endpoint as the *raw stored bytes* stream.

**Does not:**
- Change artifact storage, payload schemas, resolvers, or conversions.
- Change preview endpoints (`/table/page`, `/geo/...`).
- Add a new artifact type. Format export is presentation, not data.

## 1. The core idea: format is a property of *types*, not *instances*

An artifact is an instance of an `ArtifactTypeSpec`. The set of formats it can
be downloaded as is naturally a property of the **type** (every
`table.data@1` artifact can become CSV), not of each artifact instance.
So we attach the format table to the type declaration, right beside `title`
and `payload_schema`:

```python
ArtifactTypeSpec(
    key=ArtifactTypeKey("table.data", 1),
    title="Table",
    payload_schema=...,
    export_formats=(
        ArtifactExportFormat(
            format="json",
            content_type="application/json",
            filename="table.json",
        ),
        ArtifactExportFormat(
            format="csv",
            content_type="text/csv",
            filename="table.csv",
        ),
        ArtifactExportFormat(
            format="xlsx",
            content_type="application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet",
            filename="table.xlsx",
        ),
    ),
)
```

### Format taxonomy

| Format | Meaning | Typical artifact types |
|---|---|---|
| `json` | The **whole artifact** as one JSON document (its canonical payload) | every type with a payload |
| `txt` | A **text scalar** as bare text (no envelope) | `scalar.text@1`, `text.markdown@1`, `llm.completion` content |
| `csv` | A **table** streamed as delimited rows (full artifact, not a page) | `table.data@1`, `sql.result@1` (projected table) |
| `xlsx` | A table as a workbook | `table.data@1` |
| `png` / `webp` | Raster / image bytes | `image/*`, `geo.raster_scan` tiles |
| `geojson` | Feature collection as GeoJSON | `geo.feature_collection@1` |
| `pmtiles` | Vector archive | `geo.feature_collection@1` projection |

Not every format applies to every type. The type's `export_formats` tuple is
the **allow-list**; anything outside it is rejected with a clear error. This is
the key safety property — we never guess what a type can export.

---

## 2. Default format per artifact kind

To make "just download it" work without a picker, each type also declares a
**default** format (first entry in `export_formats`). The convention:

| Artifact kind | Default format | Why |
|---|---|---|
| JSON payloads (`llm.*`, `sql.result`, `ocr.*`) | `json` | whole-document is the faithful representation |
| Text scalars (`scalar.text`, `text.markdown`) | `txt` | users want the bare value, not `{"value": ...}` |
| Tables (`table.data`) | `csv` | spreadsheet-friendly, most common human use |
| Geo feature collections | `geojson` | interoperable, drop into GIS tools |
| Raster / images | `png` | original bytes |

The default is what the plain "Download" button does; the picker lets a user
override it.

---

## 3. Endpoint design

One endpoint, one query parameter, one attachment:

```
GET /v1/workspaces/{workspace_id}/artifacts/{artifact_id}/download?format=csv
```

- **Auth:** `require_workspace_capability(WorkspaceCapability.VIEW_ARTIFACTS)`
  — same as every existing artifact view endpoint. Download is read-only.
- **Validation:** `format` must be in the type's `export_formats` allow-list.
  Unknown or unsupported → `400` with a message listing supported formats.
- **Success:** returns the rendered bytes as `Content-Disposition: attachment`,
  with `filename` derived from the format entry (plus the artifact id so
  filenames are unique and safe, e.g. `table-<id>.csv`).
- **Errors:** `404` (missing artifact), `400` (bad format / bad request),
  `500` (content unavailable) — mirroring the existing artifacts routes.

### Why a new endpoint instead of overloading `/content`

The existing `/content` is defined as *raw stored bytes* and is already used by
the frontend to fetch JSON for previews (with `Accept: application/json`).
Overloading it with a `format` parameter would conflate two very different
semantics:

- Raw bytes is a **read-back of storage** (returns exactly what the writer
  wrote, including envelopes like `{"value": "..."}`).
- Format export is a **rendering** (produces `value` as bare text, or a table
  as CSV).

Keeping them separate means `/content` stays a faithful storage read while
`/download` is the presentation layer. This matches the existing split between
`/content` and the preview endpoints (`/table/page`, `/geo/...`).

---

## 4. Rendering rules per format

Export is a **renderer** in the API service layer — it reads the artifact the
same way previews already do, then serializes. It never mutates storage.

### `json` — whole artifact
Reuse the existing `load_content` reconstruction path (table dump, geo
reconstruction) and return it as `application/json`. For inline payloads, this
is the canonical payload document. For chunked tables, the reconstructed
`Table` model dump. This is the only format that can be large; apply the
existing byte-budget discipline where relevant.

### `txt` — text scalar
For `scalar.text@1` and `text.markdown@1`, return the **value field** directly
(`TextValuePayload.value` / `MarkdownValue.markdown`) as `text/plain; charset=utf-8`,
not the JSON envelope. This is the single most valuable download for text
artifacts and the clearest gap today: `/content` currently returns the whole
`{"value": "..."}` envelope, which is useless for "give me the text."

### `csv` — table
Load the full `Table` via `load_table_artifact` (the same reader previews use)
and serialize columns + rows to RFC-4180 CSV:

- Column headers from `TableColumn.id` (fall back to `title` when id is an
  opaque slug).
- Cell values: strings quoted as needed; numbers/booleans as literals; nested
  JSON values as compact JSON text.
- **Row limit guard:** reuse `TABLE_INTERACTION_ROW_LIMIT` so we never stream a
  multi-million-row table into memory. Large tables return `400` with a clear
  message; this is a deliberate first-release bound.

### `xlsx` — table workbook
Same full-`Table` reader, then stream to an `.xlsx` workbook. This adds a
dependency; mark as a later-phase format (see Phase 4).

### `geojson` / `pmtiles` — geo
Reuse the existing geo reconstruction (`GeoFeatureCollectionPayload` →
GeoJSON) and the existing PMTiles archive loader. `pmtiles` returns the stored
archive bytes as `application/vnd.pmtiles` — identical to the vector projection
served by `/geo/vector.pmtiles`, just framed as an attachment.

### `png` — raster / image
Return the stored bytes as `image/png`. For `geo.raster_scan`, the stored
source raster is the sensible whole-artifact download (not an individual tile).

### Formatting a filename
`{slug}-{artifact_id_short}.{extension}` where `slug` comes from the format
entry, e.g. `table-2f3a9c.csv`. Never trust `metadata["download_name"]` as the
filename — it's user-supplied metadata and could contain path separators. The
artifact id guarantees uniqueness and safety.

## 5. Frontend

### Placement: the download lives on the viewer node, under the "..." menu

The download action belongs to the **Artifact Viewer node** — not to the
workflow/producing node — because a user downloads what they are *looking at*.
Downloading before seeing contents is nonsensical; the viewer is the place
where the artifact is already rendered, so it is the natural owner of "get me
this file." It knows the focused artifact id, the workspace, and the resolved
type.

Concretely, the action sits in the viewer's **overflow menu** — the
`MoreHorizontal` ("...") popover already provided by `CanvasNodeHeader`
(`CanvasNodeChrome.tsx`) and gated on node selection, exactly like the existing
"Delete node" item. When the viewer has a renderable artifact and is selected,
"Download" appears there.

### Extending the shared header menu (OCP)

Today `CanvasNodeHeader` hard-codes only "Delete node" in its "..." popover. To
host download (and future node actions) without special-casing the shared
component, add a generic **overflow-items** prop:

```tsx
<CanvasNodeHeader
  ...
  overflowItems={[
    { id: "download", label: "Download", icon: <Download />, ... }
  ]}
/>
```

This keeps `CanvasNodeHeader` closed for modification (no viewer-specific
branch inside shared chrome) and open for extension — the same pattern as the
`children` slot that already lets `WorkflowNode` add an "Upgrade" action. Both
workflow and viewer nodes can register their own menu items.

### Format picker: one menu item per format (Phase 1)

When the focused artifact has formats, the "..." menu shows **one item per
format** ("Download as JSON", "Download as TXT", ...), each firing the download
directly. This is simpler and more discoverable than a single expanding
selector/submenu, and keeps the menu compact for Phase 1's at-most-two-formats
case. (Open decision #6 notes a later collapse to one expanding item.) Formats
come from a new field on the artifact summary response
(`download_formats: [{format, content_type, filename}]`), so the client renders
the picker without needing the full type spec.

### Wiring

- `ArtifactViewerNode` already computes `renderableOutput` (the resolved
  output); the download target is the **focused** artifact in the viewer's
  pager — the one currently rendered. `ArtifactPortPreview` reports the focused
  artifact up to the viewer via an `onFocusedArtifactChange` callback, so the
  header menu can render its formats.
- The download action navigates to `/download?format=...`
  (browser handles the attachment) via `window.location.assign`.
- Reuse the `artifactContentUrl` helper: a sibling
  `artifactDownloadUrl(workspace, artifact, format)` with the same relative
  shape (`./artifacts/{id}/download`).
- `CanvasNodeHeader` gained a generic `overflowItems` prop; the "..." menu
  renders when there are overflow items or a delete action.

### Sequence handling
For a sequence output, download targets the **focused** artifact in the pager
(consistent with "download what you're looking at"). Downloading an entire
sequence as a bundle is out of scope for the first release (see Open
decisions).

---

## 6. What we get for free (and what we avoid)

### Wins
- **One mental model**: "artifact type → formats" is a single declaration site,
  visible next to `title` and `payload_schema`.
- **Safe by construction**: an unknown type has no `export_formats`, so it
  simply has no download — we never guess. Adding a format is a one-line
  declaration, not a switch-case scattered across routes.
- **Text and tables get real downloads** — the two cases users actually reach
  for — instead of raw envelopes.
- **The action is where the user already is**: download appears in the viewer's
  "..." menu next to Delete, only when the viewer holds a renderable artifact.

### Avoided
- No new artifact types, no storage change, no resolver/conversion change.
- `/content` stays a faithful raw read; preview endpoints untouched.
- No per-instance format bookkeeping — formats live on the type, so an
  artifact never has to remember "I can be CSV."
- No download affordance on workflow/producing nodes — the viewer is the only
  place a download makes sense.

## 7. Edge cases and guards

| Case | Behavior |
|---|---|
| Format not in type allow-list | `400` listing supported formats |
| Missing artifact | `404` (existing pattern) |
| Content unavailable (deleted storage) | `500` `ArtifactContentUnavailableError` |
| Text artifact via `json` | Whole envelope `{"value": "..."}` (allowed; `json` is universal) |
| Table too large for CSV | Streams chunk-by-chunk (no memory bound); JSON still buffered at 64 MB |
| Filename collision / unsafe chars | id-suffixed slug, never raw `download_name` |
| Sequence download | Only focused artifact (first release) |
| No formats declared | Download control hidden; type is not exportable |

---

## 8. Implementation plan (phases)

**Phase 1 — JSON + TXT (highest value, zero new deps) — implemented**
- Add `ArtifactExportFormat` + `export_formats` to `ArtifactTypeSpec`.
- `json` is derived for any JSON-representable artifact (inline payload or
  `application/json` content); declare `txt` explicitly on `scalar.text@1` /
  `text.markdown@1`.
- Add the `/download` endpoint + `ArtifactService.load_download` renderer
  (`json` reuses `load_content`; `txt` extracts the bare value field).
- Add `download_formats` to `ArtifactSummaryResponse` (presenter populates it)
  and `export_formats` (optional, default empty) to the catalog
  `ArtifactTypeSpecResponse`.
- Extend `CanvasNodeHeader` with `overflowItems`; add per-format Download items
  to `ArtifactViewerNode`'s "..." menu, driven by the focused artifact via an
  `onFocusedArtifactChange` callback from `ArtifactPortPreview`.
- Regenerated the OpenAPI schema + TS contract; added backend and frontend
  tests.

**Phase 2 — CSV for tables — implemented**
- Declare `csv` on `table.data@1` (content `text/csv`, filename `table.csv`).
- `iter_table_csv` (core) streams the **full** table as CSV: chunked artifacts
  are read one stored chunk at a time into a bounded CSV buffer, so peak memory
  is one chunk + the buffer, not the whole table. No row-limit guard needed
  because it streams rather than reconstructing.
- Encoding: the output is UTF-8 with a leading BOM (`\ufeff`), CRLF line
  terminators (RFC 4180), and standard quoting (delimiters/quotes/embedded
  newlines are quoted, `"` doubled) so Excel and spreadsheet apps decode the
  file correctly rather than mojibake.
- `ArtifactContentRead` accepts a lazy async-iterable body; the `/download`
  route streams CSV without a content-length (chunked transfer).
- `sql.result@1` projected-table CSV deferred to a later pass.

**Phase 3 — Geo**
- Declare `geojson` on `geo.feature_collection@1`; `pmtiles` where a vector
  projection exists; `png` for raster sources. Reuse existing loaders.

**Phase 4 — XLSX (optional)**
- Add workbook writer dependency; declare `xlsx` on `table.data@1`.

Each phase is independently shippable and reviewable; Phase 1 alone closes the
text-scalar gap and gives every JSON artifact a real download.

---

## 9. Open decisions

1. **Sequence download** — bundle a whole sequence (zip? single JSON array?)
   or keep focused-artifact only? First release: focused only (consistent with
   "download what you're looking at").
2. **`xlsx` dependency** — worth a new workbook dependency now, or defer?
   CSV covers the spreadsheet use case in Phase 2.
3. **Filename source** — id-suffixed slug is safe but not friendly; do we want
   `metadata["source_name"]`/node titles sanitized into filenames later?
4. **Large-table strategy** — hard `400` bound vs. streaming CSV. Streaming is
   better UX but more code; hard bound is safer first.
5. **Where formats live** — on `ArtifactTypeSpec` (as proposed) vs. a separate
   registry keyed by type. The spec-field approach is simpler and keeps the
   declaration next to its type.
6. **Menu shape** — one flat "Download" item that expands to a format selector
   (as proposed) vs. one menu item per format. The single-expanding item keeps
   the "..." menu compact; a per-format row is more discoverable but noisier.

---

## 10. OpenAPI / contract surface

New schema `ArtifactExportFormatResponse { format, content_type, filename }`;
`ArtifactSummaryResponse` gains `download_formats`. New path
`/artifacts/{artifact_id}/download`. The generated `apps/web/.../grafy.ts`
contract and the artifact-viewer types update in Phase 1 (per the project's
"update OpenAPI contract and generate module API types" commit convention).
