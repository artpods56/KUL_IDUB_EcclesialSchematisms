Application of Advanced Digital Tools in Documentation Work for Historical Geography of the Church

Tested Tools:

1.  OCR (Optical Character Recognition)
2.  NLP (Natural Language Processing)
3.  Direct use of LLMs (Large Language Models)
4.  Scripts obtained from LLMs

Types of Materials:

*   Schematisms (Church administrative directories)
*   Books of endowments and retaxations (*Księgi uposażeń i retaksacji*)
*   Bystrzycki's 1933 Index of Localities in the Republic of Poland (*Skorowidz miejscowości RP*)

Type of Data Acquired - Solely concerning parish structures.

For schematisms, this is a fixed set:

*   Name of the locality serving as the parish seat and the parish itself - in the original spelling (these two fields are almost always consistent).
*   Affiliation to a higher territorial unit (deanery, possibly archdeaconry, possibly diocese) - from a list.
*   Dedication (patron saint/title) - from a list.
*   Object type (e.g., parish church, chapel) - from a list.
*   Building material and its type - from a list.

If other types of sources are included, which will become clear during the project, this list of information will be partially modified.

Research Questions:

*   What is the scale and nature of errors for individual source types (schematisms in different languages and from different periods, others) and for each category of information?
*   To what extent can these errors be measured and minimized?
*   What programming tools and competencies does this require?
*   What are the results when using the different tools listed above?
*   What are the most effective procedures for combining different tools?
*   To what extent can the process utilizing various tools be automated?
*   Are the results repeatable? What solutions can be recommended, at least for specific applications?
*   How should the successive stages of work be documented during the process to effectively replicate successful choices and avoid repeating mistakes?
*   How should the procedures used be documented for shared research data and in publications?
*   To what extent does the application of advanced digital tools accelerate the work while maintaining the same standards of result accuracy?
