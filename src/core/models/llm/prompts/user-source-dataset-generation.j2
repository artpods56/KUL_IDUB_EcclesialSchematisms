<TASK>
    Analyze the document image (source of truth) together with the provided OCR text.
    The `GROUND_TRUTH` JSON in Polish lists the parishes you must recover from the Latin page.
    Treat every Polish value as a hint onlyâ€”replace it with the Latin wording you confirm on the image, including
    headings such as the deanery name.
    For every ground truth entry, locate the exact Latin text on the page, copy it verbatim, and set missing fields to
    `null` instead of guessing.
    Return a single JSON with the same structure as `GROUND_TRUTH`, populated with the confirmed Latin text and ordered
    following the parishes' appearance on the page (top-to-bottom, left-to-right).
